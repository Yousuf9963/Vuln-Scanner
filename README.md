# What is vulnerability assessment?

Vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing the cybersecurity vulnerabilities in a given IT system. The goal of an assessment is to locate weaknesses that can be exploited to compromise systems. Examples of such weaknesses are errors in application code, misconfigured network devices, overly permissive access controls in a database, or arbitrary code execution as detected recently with Log4Shell. Vulnerability assessment is an established area of security.
